How to use the app:
We have a detailed slideshow to show how to use our app to scout in a FRC match. The slideshow is a tutorial for the android app but since both the iOS and Android app are very similar, the slide show should provide enough information for the user to understand how to use the app

In general, here are the functionalities of all elements on a scouting screen.
Buttons : Use to record an action that happens in one exact moment
Switches : Use to record actions that happens over a time period 
Toggles : Use to record the state of the robot in a match (example: Where they are on the field)
Check boxes: Use to record actions that can only be done ONCE in the entire match.
